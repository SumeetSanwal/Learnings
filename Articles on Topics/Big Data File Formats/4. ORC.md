### Introduction 
* It is a columnar based file system developed by facebook. It allows data skipping while reading without the need of large and complex indexes.
*  ORC was designed and optimized specifically with Hive data in mind, improving the overall performance when Hive reads, writes, and processes data.  As a result, ORC supports ACID transactions when working with Hive.
