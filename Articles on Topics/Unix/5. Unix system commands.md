# Unix System Commands

* `whoami` - shows current use
* `who` - shows all active users/shells
* `ps`  - show running programs
* `ps -a` - show all  user running programs
* `ps -x` - show all system and user programs
* `ps aux` - detailed listing all users
* `top` - running dashboard of all running programs
* `!!` - rerun same command last run

## Alias
* To make an alias for an command.
* Eg 
  * `alias gp='git push origin main'` //gp is alias for the command forward 
* Can add these alias in .zshrc file and they would then run and setup each time the terminal is started.



## STOP PROCESS 
* `kill -9 123`  // kill process with pid=123


## COMMAND HISTORY
* `history` //last 15 commands in zsh shell
* `cat .zsh_history` //this files saves commands when switch off


## DIRECTING OUTPUT TO FILE
* echo 'Hello' > file.txt // The greater than '>' is used to direct output to file specified after it.
* `>` - This overwrittes the data in the file
* `>>` - This appends to end of file
* `<` - To provide input file


## Pipeling
* `command | command 2 `// output of command becomes input of command 2.
* Eg : `history 1 | grep nano` // Return all commands which have nano in it. History 1 returns all commands used history and then Grep is used to search with keyword.


## Suppress Output
* `ps aux > /dev/null` //send output to /dev/null which is just discarded.
 
## source command
* The source command reads and executes commands from the file specified as its argument in the current shell environment.
* Eg : 
  * source ./activate
  * source ~/.zshrc


## AWK
* Important and versatile command to learn if needed.
* cat unix.txt | awk -F 'abc' '{print $2}' // read file unix, print everything after abc in each line i.e remove everything before the match string.


## NVI

* `du file1.txt` // disk usage of any file
* `df -h` //show amount of free disk space
