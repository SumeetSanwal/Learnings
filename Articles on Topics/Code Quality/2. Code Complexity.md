* <h3> What ? </h3>
  
    * It is a measure of how complex the code is both from a functional and cognitive standpoint.

* <h3> Why ? </h3>

    * It is a measure used to understand the quality of code.

* <h3> How ? </h3>

  * [cyclomatic & cognitive complexity examples](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability/)
  * Cyclomatic Complexity : 
    * The cyclomatic complexity is the number of different pathways through the control flow graph. More the number of flows, the higher the complexity.
    * 1 is the base complexity of a function
    * +1 for each 'if', 'for', 'case', '&&' or '||'
  * Cognitive Complexity : 
    * This measures the amount of cognitive effort required to understand the code's flow.
