<h2> Code Duplication </h2>

* <h3> What? </h3>
  
    * The same sequence of code being used repeatedly across the application.
    * It is bad because whenever the code needs to be changed it has to be changed at all the places. Hence, maintenance of code is difficult.  

* <h3> How to measure? </h3>

    * Sonar, Simian tools allow to detect code duplication in application. 



* <h3> Principles </h3>

  * DRY Principle 

    * DRY stand for "Don't Repeat Yourself," a basic principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of information. The DRY principle is stated as, "Every piece of knowledge or logic must have a single, unambiguous representation within a system."


  * KISS Principle

    * KISS is an acronym for Keep It Simple, Stupid. This principle says about to make your code simple. You should avoid unnecessary complexity. A simple code it’s easier to maintain and easier to understand.    


  * YAGNI Principle 

    * YAGNI stands for You Ain’t Gonna Need It. It’s a principle from software development methodology of Extreme Programming (XP). This principle says that you should not create features that it’s not really necessary.


Eg : 
* Each method should never be more than 40-50 lines.
* Each class should never be more than 200 lines.
